## Welcome to BigHobbits

The BigHobbits are a team of 4 graduate student from **Arizona State University** working in three different labs on AR, security and application development. 

We are working on **WisdomPortal-One** which aims at bringing live classroom experience to your doorstep using **MagicLeap-One**.

## About WisdomPortal-One
WisdomPortal-One by the BigHobbits is a first of its kind unique Live Classroom/Workshop experience which takes a user directly to the live show from their own house.

A few days back, we wanted to attend DroidCon at SanFrancisco but we couldn't because of monetary issues. Even though the whole event was live streamed (at least the talks) but we missed on the experience that we would have gotten if we would have attended the event in person.

We want to bridge that missing experience through "WisdomPortal-One".

We understand that bringing a live in-person experience for an event is a little far-fetched goal for the team currently and hence we want to start with bringing live classroom experience to our users. The motivation behind Live Classroom is that even though there are lots of pre-recorded session/videos that a user can find on the internet and learn from but still there is a gap of active learning and mentorship which a person only gets from a live classroom experience.

We believe WisdomPortal-One is the future of Online Learning by providing a mixed reality experience to our users. With the help of MagicLeapOne, they will find themselves immersed in the live classroom session where they can interact with other fellows classmates and teachers alike, ask questions in real time and also bookmark & record sessions in real-time.
